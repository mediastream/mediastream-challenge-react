/**
 * Exercise 01: The Retro Movie Store
 * Implement a shopping cart with the next features for the Movie Store that is selling retro dvds:
 *[OK] 1. Add a movie to the cart
 *[OK] 2. Increment or decrement the quantity of movie copies. If quantity is equal to 0, the movie must be removed from the cart
 *[OK] 3. Calculate and show the total cost of your cart. Ex: Total: $150
 *[OK] 4. Apply discount rules. You have an array of offers with discounts depending of the combination of movie you have in your cart.
 * You have to apply all discounts in the rules array (discountRules).
 * Ex: If m:Â [1, 2, 3], it means the discount will be applied to the total when the cart has all that products in only.
 *
 * You can modify all the code, this component isn't well designed intentionally. You can redesign it as you need.
