/**
 * Exercise 02: Movie Library
 * We are trying to make a movie library for internal users. We are facing some issues by creating this, try to help us following the next steps:
 * !IMPORTANT: Make sure to run yarn movie-api for this exercise
 * 1. We have an issue fetching the list of movies, check why and fix it (handleMovieFetch)
 * 2. Create a filter by fetching the list of gender (http://localhost:3001/genres) and then loading
 * list of movies that belong to that gender (Filter all movies).
 * 3. Order the movies by year and implement a button that switch between ascending and descending order for the list
 * 4. Try to recreate the user interface that comes with the exercise (exercise02.png)
 * 
 * You can modify all the code, this component isn't well designed intentionally. You can redesign it as you need.
